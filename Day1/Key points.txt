Key points:
1. It's easy to learn
2. OOP's
3. No need to declare the variable and no need to declare with a specific data type  
space complexity:
The amount of space taken in CPU by your program 
Time complexity:
The amount of time dedicated by the CPU to solve the given problem
Efficiency:
Taking less Space and less time to solve the problem
we are not using sorting techniques as sort technique is built in function.
Tc/Sc
Searching: Linear O(n), Binary O(log(n)) 
Sorting: Quick O(n*log(n)), Merge O(n*log(n)) (pakka Question in technical round), Bubble

Home work:
which is the best out of merge and quick which has same time and why?


Data types:
int, float, tuple, bool, set, dic, list, str, set.


tomorrow's agenda:
1. Functions
2. Recursions
3. Tuple
4. list (imp)
5. dic
6. Sets
