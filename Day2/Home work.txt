1) what is mean by 32bit and 64 bit?
 the number of bits used to represent memory addresses and data values in a computer. 
 64-bit systems offer more memory addressability, processing power, and are generally 
 better suited for modern computing tasks, while 32-bit systems are still sufficient 
 for many everyday tasks, but may have limitations when it comes to memory and processing 
 power.
